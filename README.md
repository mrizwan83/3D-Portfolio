# 3D Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills and current work experience. The site is built using Three.js, Tailwind CSS, and React.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of my portfolio site: [https://mrizwan-portfolio.vercel.app/](https://mrizwan-portfolio.vercel.app/)

## Features

- React Timeline, React Tilt, Framer Motion, React-Three-Fiber

## Technologies

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Three.js: A 3D library to create WebGL-powered 3D animations in the browser.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a development environment and run the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mrizwan83/3D-Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd 3D-Portfolio
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

To start the development server and view the site in your browser:

```
npm run dev
```

The site should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Deployment

To build the project for production:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create a build folder containing the optimized production build of your site.
